# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis & Visualization

A comprehensive data analysis and visualization project exploring the famous Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns and insights through statistical analysis and compelling visualizations.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger data to understand the factors that influenced survival rates during the tragic 1912 disaster. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and multiple visualization techniques, we explore relationships between passenger characteristics and their likelihood of survival.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of passenger demographics and characteristics
- **Survival Pattern Analysis**: Identify key factors that influenced passenger survival rates
- **Data Storytelling**: Create compelling visualizations that tell the story of the Titanic disaster
- **Statistical Insights**: Extract meaningful insights through data-driven analysis

## 📊 Dataset Information

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including:

- **Passenger Details**: Name, Age, Sex, Class
- **Family Information**: Siblings/Spouses (SibSp), Parents/Children (Parch)
- **Ticket Information**: Fare, Ticket number, Cabin
- **Embarkation**: Port of embarkation
- **Survival**: Target variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

### Key Findings:
- **Gender & Survival**: Women had significantly higher survival rates than men
- **Class Impact**: First-class passengers had better survival chances
- **Age Factor**: Children had higher survival rates
- **Family Size**: Moderate family sizes showed better survival rates
- **Embarkation Point**: Port of embarkation influenced survival rates

### Visualizations Included:
1. **Overview Analysis**: Correlation matrix and data distribution
2. **Survival Analysis**: Overall survival rates and demographics
3. **Gender & Class Analysis**: Survival rates by gender and passenger class
4. **Age Distribution**: Age patterns and their impact on survival
5. **Family Analysis**: How family size affected survival chances
6. **Fare Analysis**: Economic factors and survival correlation
7. **Embarkation Analysis**: Port-wise survival patterns
